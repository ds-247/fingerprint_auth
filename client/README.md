# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# WebAuthn Passkey System Clarifications

### Point 1:

> **At the time of registration, the new private key and public key are created by the application, but in order to create that, I have to first authorize myself by providing the passkey to the device, as the device is the thing that creates that public-private key pair.**

This is **mostly correct** but let's clarify the terminology:

- During **registration**, the **device** (not the web application) is responsible for generating the **public-private key pair**. The application (your web app) provides the challenge and necessary information, but the **device’s authenticator** (such as a biometric sensor, PIN, or hardware key) is what creates the cryptographic keys.

- **Authorization via Passkey**: When registering, you must **authorize yourself** on the device using a **passkey mechanism** (e.g., fingerprint, PIN, Face ID). This passkey is the **local authentication mechanism** that tells the device it is you, allowing the device to generate the public-private key pair for that specific web application.

  - **Important distinction**: The **passkey mechanism** (e.g., fingerprint or PIN) is **not the key itself**. It’s the method by which the device ensures that only the legitimate user can generate or use the private key.

---

### Point 2:

> **If I change the passkey of the device (suppose earlier my passkey is "abcd" and later it becomes "bcde"), then in that condition, I can't log in to the web app.**

This is **correct**.

- **Private Key Tied to Passkey Mechanism**: The private key stored on your device is linked to your **passkey mechanism** (biometric, PIN, etc.). If you change or reset your device's passkey mechanism, such as:

  - Removing or changing a fingerprint
  - Resetting your PIN
  - Reconfiguring Face ID

  Then the **original private key** associated with your web app may no longer be accessible.

- This is because the private key is stored securely in the device, and access to that private key requires the **same user verification method** (passkey mechanism) that was used during registration.

---

### Point 2 Follow-Up:

> **Isn't it inconvenient that if I change the passkey of the device, I also have to re-register myself to the web app? And if re-registration happens, is the previous data lost?**

Yes, this can be **inconvenient** in certain scenarios, but there are important reasons for this design. Let’s break it down:

#### Why Changing the Device's Passkey Requires Re-Registration:

1. **Security Design**:

   - The **private key** that is stored on your device is secured behind your passkey mechanism (e.g., fingerprint, PIN).
   - If the passkey mechanism changes, it’s assumed that the **device has been reset** or **new credentials** have been created. In this case, the private key generated earlier is no longer available to use.
   - From a security standpoint, the WebAuthn system is designed to **not trust** old credentials if the user verification mechanism changes.

2. **Re-Registration**:

   - Yes, if you change the passkey mechanism (like changing fingerprints, resetting PIN), you will have to **re-register** with the web app. This means creating a new public-private key pair that is linked to the new verification method.
   - This ensures that only the current verification method (e.g., the new fingerprint or PIN) is authorized to access the private key.

3. **Does Re-Registration Mean Data is Lost?**

   - **No**, the previous data associated with the user on the server does not necessarily need to be lost. The key point is:

     - The **public key** stored on the server **is tied to the original private key** (the one linked to the old passkey mechanism).
     - After re-registration, the server can associate the **new public key** with the existing user account. This way, you can still retain your previous account information, but with a new passkey.

   - However, this requires your **backend** to handle this properly. For example, after re-registration, your server can update the user's credentials without deleting any other user data.

---

### Why This Design Is Secure but Can Be Inconvenient

- **Security**: The system is designed this way for **maximum security**. If changing the device's passkey (e.g., replacing your fingerprint or PIN) automatically kept the old private key accessible, it would make the entire security model less robust. This way, **only the verified user** can access their credentials.

- **Inconvenience**: Yes, it can be inconvenient because if you change your device's passkey, you must re-register for all the web apps that use WebAuthn. However, this inconvenience is a tradeoff for **better security**.

---

### Summary:

1. **At registration**, the device generates a new public-private key pair, and you need to authorize yourself using a passkey mechanism (biometrics, PIN, etc.) to create the keys.
2. **If you change the device's passkey mechanism**, such as resetting your PIN or changing fingerprints, the original private key is no longer accessible, meaning you can't log in without re-registering.

3. **Re-registration doesn’t mean all your data is lost**, but the web app needs to handle it correctly to update your credentials without wiping the account data. This process ensures that you are still associated with the same account but using a new passkey.
